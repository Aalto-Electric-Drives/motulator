# Reference Generation

## For Induction Machines

For induction machines, the {class}`motulator.drive.control.im.ReferenceGenerator` class implements a simple reference generation that can be used with flux-vector control. [Figure 1](fig:im_ref_gen) illustrates this method that consists of field weakening, current limitation (CL), and breakdown torque limitation.

For current limitation, the priority is given to the flux. The stator flux limit and the torque limit, respectively, are

```{math}
---
label: im_cl
---
    \psi_\mathrm{s}^\mathrm{cl} &= \hatLsgm \ismax + \hatabspsiR \\
    \tau_\mathrm{M}^\mathrm{cl} &= \frac{3\np}{2} \hatabspsiR \sqrt{(\ismax)^2 - \left(\frac{\hatabspsiR}{\hatLM}\right)^2}
```

where $\hatabspsiR$ is the rotor flux magnitude estimate and $\ismax$ is the maximum current. The breakdown torque limit is

```{math}
---
label: im_bd_lim
---
    \tau_\mathrm{M}^\mathrm{b} = \frac{3\np}{2} \frac{(\abspsisref)^2}{2\hat{L}_\ell}
```

where the leakage inductance estimate can be expressed by means of the inverse-Î“ parameters as $\hat L_\ell = [(\hatLM + \hatLsgm)/\hatLM]\hatLsgm$.

This reference generation is used in the {class}`motulator.drive.control.im.FluxVectorController` class, which implements flux-vector control for induction machines. See also the {doc}`/drive_examples/flux_vector/plot_2kw_im_sat_fvc` example.

The limited torque reference is denoted by $\overline{\tau}_\mathrm{M}^\mathrm{ref}$ and the rated stator flux by $\psi_\mathrm{s}^\mathrm{nom}$. The parameter $k_\mathrm{u}$ is the voltage utilization factor.

## For Synchronous Machines

For synchronous machines, the {class}`motulator.drive.control.sm.ReferenceGenerator` class implements the optimal reference generation that can be used both with current-vector control and flux-vector control. [Figure 2](fig:sm_ref_gen) illustrates this method, including field weakening, maximum-torque-per-ampere (MTPA), maximum-power-per-voltage (MTPV), and current limitation (CL) {cite}`Mey2006, Awa2018`. [Figure 3](fig:flux_vs_torque) shows an example of the optimal reference characteristics for a 5.6-kW permanent-magnet synchronous reluctance machine (PM-SyRM). See also the {ref}`mtpa_mtpv` document and the {doc}`/drive_examples/flux_vector/plot_6kw_pmsyrm_sat_fvc` example for more details.

Note that the reference generation of flux-vector control is simpler than that of current-vector control, since the two-dimensional transformation to the current reference is avoided. For simplicity, we compute this transformation to the current vector using the root-finding method, while other approaches such as a two-dimensional lookup table could be used.

These are single-dimensional lookup tables, see the example in [Figure 2](fig:flux_vs_torque). Two-dimensional transformation to the current reference is needed only in the case of current-vector control.
