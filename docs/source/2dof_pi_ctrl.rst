2DOF PI Controller
==================

A proportional-integral (PI) controller is widely used in motor drives. The standard one-degree-of-freedom (1DOF) PI controller manipulates only the control error, i.e., it has single input and single output. Its two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) version has two inputs (reference signal and feedback signal), which allows to design disturbance rejection and reference tracking separately. The 2DOF PI controller can also be understood as a state feedback controller with intergral action and reference feedforward. 

In the following, we will use the 2DOF PI speed controller as an example, cf. the :class:`motulator.control.common.SpeedCtrl` class. However, the 2DOF PI controller can be used for other control tasks as well. If desired, the 2DOF PI controller can be parametrized to be a 1DOF PI controller.

Continuous-Time Domain
----------------------

Even if controllers operate in the discrete-time domain, they are often designed and analyzed in the continuous-time domain.  

Typical Structure
"""""""""""""""""

The state-space form of the PI speed controller is given by

.. math::
	\frac{\mathrm{d} \tau_\mathrm{i}}{\mathrm{d} t} &= k_\mathrm{i}\left(\omega_\mathrm{M,ref} - \omega_\mathrm{M}\right) \\
    	\tau_\mathrm{M,ref} &= k_\mathrm{t}\omega_\mathrm{M,ref} - k_\mathrm{p}\omega_\mathrm{M} + \tau_\mathrm{i} 

where :math:`\omega_\mathrm{M}` is the measured (or estimated) mechanical angular speed of the rotor, :math:`\omega_\mathrm{M,ref}` is the reference angular speed, and :math:`\tau_\mathrm{i}` is the the integral state. Furhtermore, :math:`k_\mathrm{t}` is the reference feedforward gain, :math:`k_\mathrm{p}` is the proportional gain, and :math:`k_\mathrm{i}` is the integral gain. Setting :math:`k_\mathrm{t} = k_\mathrm{p}` results in the standard 1DOF PI controller.

..
    For analysis purposes, the above controller can be presented in the Laplace domain as
..
    .. math::
	\tau_\mathrm{M,ref}(s) = K(s) \left[\omega_\mathrm{M,ref}(s) - \omega_\mathrm{M}(s)\right] + (k_\mathrm{t} - k_\mathrm{p})\omega_\mathrm{M,ref}(s) 
..
    where
..
    .. math::
	K(s) = k_\mathrm{p} + \frac{k_\mathrm{i}}{s}
..
    is the standard PI controller.

Disturbance-Observer-Based Stucture
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The above 2DOF PI controller can be equally represented using the disturbance-observer based structure,

.. math::
	\frac{\mathrm{d} \tau_\mathrm{i}}{\mathrm{d} t} &= \alpha\left(\tau_\mathrm{M,ref} - \hat \tau_\mathrm{L}\right) \\
    \hat \tau_\mathrm{L} &= \tau_\mathrm{i} - (k_\mathrm{p} - k_\mathrm{t})\omega_\mathrm{M} \\
    \tau_\mathrm{M,ref} &= k_\mathrm{t}\left(\omega_\mathrm{M,ref} - \omega_\mathrm{M}\right) + \hat \tau_\mathrm{L} 

where :math:`\alpha = k_\mathrm{i}/k_\mathrm{t}` is the redefined gain and :math:`\hat \tau_\mathrm{L} = \tau_\mathrm{i} - (k_\mathrm{p} - k_\mathrm{t})\omega_\mathrm{M}` is the estimated load torque. This structure is more convenient to prevent the integral windup that originates from the actuator saturation; the electromagnetic torque is limited in practice due to the maximum current of the inverter (and possibly due to other constraints as well). Consequently, the realized (limited) torque reference is

.. math::
    \overline{\tau}_\mathrm{M,ref} = \mathrm{sat}(\tau_\mathrm{M,ref})

where :math:`\mathrm{sat}(\cdot)` is the saturation function. If this saturation function is known, the anti-windup of the integrator can be implemented simply as

.. math::
	\frac{\mathrm{d} \tau_\mathrm{i}}{\mathrm{d} t} = \alpha\left(\overline{\tau}_\mathrm{M,ref} - \hat \tau_\mathrm{L}\right) 

The other parts of the above controller are not affected by the saturation. The implementation in the :class:`motulator.control.common.SpeedCtrl` class is based on this disturbance-based-observer form.

Gain Selection Example
""""""""""""""""""""""

For simplicity, let us assume ideal torque control (:math:`\tau_\mathrm{M} = \tau_\mathrm{M,ref}`) and a stiff mechanical system

.. math::
    J\frac{\mathrm{d}\omega_\mathrm{M}}{\mathrm{d} t} = \tau_\mathrm{M} - \tau_\mathrm{L}

where :math:`\tau_\mathrm{M}` is the electromagnetic torque, :math:`\tau_\mathrm{L}` is the load torque, and :math:`J` is the total moment of inertia. In the Laplace domain, the resulting closed-loop system is given by

.. math::
    \omega_\mathrm{M}(s) = \frac{k_\mathrm{t} s + k_\mathrm{i}}{J s^2 + k_\mathrm{p} s + k_\mathrm{i}} \omega_\mathrm{M,ref}(s) - \frac{s}{J s^2 + k_\mathrm{p} s + k_\mathrm{i}} \tau_\mathrm{L}(s)

where it can be seen that the gain :math:`k_\mathrm{t}` allows to place the reference-tracking zero. The gain selection 

.. math::
    k_\mathrm{t} = \alpha_\mathrm{s} J \qquad
    k_\mathrm{p} = 2\alpha_\mathrm{s} J \qquad
    k_\mathrm{i} = \alpha_\mathrm{s}^2 J 

results in 

.. math::
    \omega_\mathrm{M}(s) = \frac{\alpha_\mathrm{s}}{s + \alpha_\mathrm{s}} \omega_\mathrm{M,ref}(s) - \frac{s}{J (s + \alpha_\mathrm{s})^2} \tau_\mathrm{L}(s)

where :math:`\alpha_\mathrm{s}` is the closed-loop bandwidth of the first-order reference-tracking response.

Discrete-Time Domain
--------------------

The discrete-time variant of the controller is given by

.. math::
	\tau_\mathrm{i}(k+1) &= \tau_\mathrm{i}(k) + T_\mathrm{s} \alpha \left[\overline{\tau}_\mathrm{M,ref}(k) - \hat \tau_\mathrm{L}(k) \right] \\
    \hat \tau_\mathrm{L}(k) &= \tau_\mathrm{i}(k) - (k_\mathrm{p} - k_\mathrm{t})\omega_\mathrm{M}(k) \\
    \tau_\mathrm{M,ref}(k) &= k_\mathrm{t}\left[\omega_\mathrm{M,ref}(k) - \omega_\mathrm{M}(k)\right] + \hat \tau_\mathrm{L}(k) \\
    \overline{\tau}_\mathrm{M,ref}(k) &= \mathrm{sat}[\tau_\mathrm{M,ref}(k)]

where :math:`T_\mathrm{s}` is the sampling period and :math:`k` is the discrete-time index. This corresponds to the implementation in the :class:`motulator.control.common.SpeedCtrl` class.
