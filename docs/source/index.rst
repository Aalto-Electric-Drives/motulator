*motulator:* Motor Drive Simulator in Python
============================================

This open-source software includes simulation models for an induction machine, a synchronous reluctance machine, and a permanent-magnet synchronous machine. The machine models are simulated in the continuous-time domain while the control algorithms run in discrete time. The default solver is the explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 5(4) from `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`_. Simple control algorithms are provided as examples. The example algorithms aim to be simple yet feasible.

This project has been sponsored by ABB Oy and by the Academy of Finland *Centre of Excellence in High-Speed Electromechanical Energy Conversion Systems*. The example control methods included in this repository are based on published algorithms (available in textbooks and scientific articles). They do not present any proprietary control software.
