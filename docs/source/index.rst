*motulator:* Motor Drive and Grid Converter Simulator in Python
===============================================================

This open-source software includes simulation models and controllers for electric machine drives and grid-connected converters.
The machine models include an induction machine, a synchronous reluctance machine, and a permanent-magnet synchronous machine.
Various models are provided for grid converter-related electrical subsystems such as an inductive-capacitive-inductive (LCL) filter connected to an inductive-resistive grid.

The system models are simulated in the continuous-time domain while the control methods run in discrete time.
The default solver is the explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 5(4) from `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`_.
A number of control methods are provided as examples. The example methods aim to be simple yet feasible.
