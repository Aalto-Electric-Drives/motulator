Drive System
============

Machine drives are sampled-data systems, consisting of continuous-time systems and discrete-time systems as well as the interfaces between them [#Fra1997]_, [#Bus2015]_. The figure below shows a generic example system. The same architecture is used in *motulator*.

   Block diagram of a sampled-data system. Discrete signals and systems are shown in blue, and continuous signals and systems are shown in red. 

The continuous-time system (named `mdl` in :doc:`/auto_examples/index`) is the model of a physical machine drive system, typically consisting of a machine, mechanics, and power converter. The continuous-time system may have external inputs, such as a load torque.

The discrete-time controller (named `ctrl`) contains control algorithms, such as the current control and speed control. The reference signals could be, e.g., the speed and flux references. The feedback signal :math:`\boldsymbol{y}(k)` typically contains the measured DC-bus voltage and stator currents. 

Digital control systems typically have a computational delay of one sampling period, :math:`N=1`. The PWM block shown in the figure models the carrier comparison, see more details in :doc:`converters`. The carrier comparison is implemented in the class :class:`motulator.drive.model.CarrierComparison`. If the switching ripple is not of interest in simulations, the carrier comparison can be replaced with zero-order hold (ZOH).
