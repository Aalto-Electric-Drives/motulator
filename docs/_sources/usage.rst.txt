Usage
-----
The main folder includes the example script :mod:`sim` to run the simulation. The folder :mod:`config` contains example configuration files that can be modified or used as templates for new ones. There are separate config files for the drive system (e.g. :mod:`config.mdl_im_2kW`) and for its controller (e.g. :mod:`config.ctrl_vector_im_2kW`). For example, pulse-width modulation (PWM) can be enabled in the drive system config file. The control system can be configured to operate in a sensorless or sensored mode.
