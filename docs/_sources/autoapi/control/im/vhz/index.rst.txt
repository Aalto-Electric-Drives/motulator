:py:mod:`control.im.vhz`
========================

.. py:module:: control.im.vhz

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   This module includes V/Hz control for induction motor drives. The method
   is similar to the paper "On the stability of volts-per-hertz control for
   induction motors":

       https://doi.org/10.1109/JESTPE.2021.3060583

   Open-loop V/Hz control can be obtained as a special case by choosing:

       R_s, R_R = 0, 0
       k_u, k_w = 0, 0

   .. rubric:: Notes

   The low-pass-filtered values are marked with ref at the end of the variable
   name. These slowly varying quasi-steady-state quantities can be seen to
   represent the operating point.
