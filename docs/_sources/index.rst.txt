   usage

This open-source software includes simulation models for an induction motor, a synchronous reluctance motor, and a permanent-magnet synchronous motor. The motor models are simulated in the continuous-time domain while the control algorithms run in discrete time. The default solver is the explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 5(4) from `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`_. Simple control algorithms are provided as examples. The example algorithms aim to be simple yet feasible, and they have not been optimized.
