# Usage

After {doc}`installation`, *motulator* can be used by creating a continuous-time system model, a discrete-time controller, and a simulation object. The {doc}`/drive_examples/index` and {doc}`/grid_examples/index` examples include a variety of different scripts to run the simulation. System model and controller configurations can be changed as shown in the examples. Furthermore, new features can be added by modifying the source code.
