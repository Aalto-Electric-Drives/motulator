Flux-Vector Control
-------------------

These examples demonstrate flux-vector control of synchronous machine drives 
[#Pel2009]_. In the implemented controller, rotor coordinates as well as 
decoupling between the stator flux and torque channels are used according to 
[#Awa2019]_. Furthermore, the stator flux magnitude and the electromagnetic 
torque are selected as controllable variables.
