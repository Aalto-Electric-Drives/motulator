Flux-Vector Control
-------------------

These examples demonstrate flux-vector control of electric machine drives [#Pel2009]_. In the implemented control system, decoupling between the stator flux and torque channels are used according to [#Awa2019]_. Furthermore, the stator flux magnitude and the electromagnetic torque are selected as controllable variables. The implementation of sensorless mode corresponds to [#Tii2024]_.
