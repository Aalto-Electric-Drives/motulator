Current-Vector Control
----------------------

These examples are for current-vector control of induction and synchronous machines. The magnetic saturation model of an induction machine is also demonstrated (:doc:`/drive_examples/current_vector/plot_current_vector_im_2kw`) as well as computation of control lookup tables for synchronous machines (:doc:`/drive_examples/current_vector/plot_current_vector_pmsyrm_thor_sat`).
