Signal Injection
----------------

These examples demonstrate a square-wave signal injection for low-speed 
operation based on [#Kim2012]_. A phase-locked loop is used to track the rotor 
position. For a wider speed range, signal injection could be combined to a 
model-based observer. The effects of magnetic saturation are not compensated 
for in this version.
