Signal Injection
----------------

These examples demonstrate a square-wave signal injection for low-speed operation based on [#Kim2012]_. Cross-saturation errors are compensated for using flux maps [#You2018]_. A phase-locked loop is used to track the rotor position. For a wider speed range, signal injection could be combined to a model-based observer.
